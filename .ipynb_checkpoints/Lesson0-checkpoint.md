# Lesson 0: Configuring your computer (in 7 easy steps)

### The Following protocol assumes you are using a Mac (i.e. Unix). Things will be a little different if you are using a computer running Linux or Windows operating systems.

## 0.1. First things first, make sure your computer's operating system is up to date

## 0.2. Find your Terminal application

Press `Command` + `spacebar` to launch Spotlight. Type "Terminal" into the search bar, and then double-click the top search result. You could also search for Terminal using the Finder function on Macs.

You will want easy access to Terminal in the future. Right-click the Terminal icon on your dock and select `Options > Keep in Dock`

The "Windows Subsystem for Linux" lets you run a Linux Terminal on Windows. There is a tutorial for installing the subsystem at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10. I am currently using WSL 1 and the "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS" Distribution on my PC. You will need to locate your PowerShell program to install Windows Subsystem for Linux; you can find it by typing "PowerShell" into your computer's search bar.</div>

## 0.3. Install XCode (Mac Only)

Xcode provides a suite of development tools and libraries produced by Apple. Xcode's __Command Line Tools__ are particularly important as they include the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) compiler, which is required by many of the programs we use. 

You can either download [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from the Apple App Store or install the command line tools directly by pasting the following command into Terminal:
