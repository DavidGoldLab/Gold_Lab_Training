    "\n",
    "In comparative genomics, our goal is to understand the evolution and function of genes (as well as other genetic elements). To compare genes between individuals or species, we need to indetify __homologous__ bits of DNA. [Homologous DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_homology) is DNA that is conserved between to organisms because it was present in their last common ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can identify homolgous DNA between organisms based on how simmilar their DNA or amino acid (if we are working with proteins) sequences are. __While simmilarities between DNA can be expressed as a percentage (a gene between humans and mice might be 78% simmilar in its DNA sequences) homology is binary; genes either are or are not shared from a last common ancestor.__"

    "To perform this exercise, we’re going to use the [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This is a public database with nearly all of the genetic material scientists have sequenced and published.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we’re going to use a program on NCBI called __BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)__. BLAST takes a query sequence that you provide, and compares it against all sequences in the NCBI database. It looks for similar sequences that might be homologous.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four different versions of BLAST, depending on what you want to use for the query and the database. Keep in mind that to compare DNA to proteins, the DNA first has to be __translated__ into amino acids:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Nucelotide BLAST (blastn__): compares a DNA query to a DNA database\n",
    "- __Protein BLAST (blastp)__: compares a protein query to a protein database\n",

    "- __tblastn__: compares a protein query to a translated DNA database\n",
    "- __tblastx__: compares a translated DNA query to a translated DNA database\n",
    "\n",
    "The program you want to use depends on what you’re trying to accomplish. If you want to find homologous sequences from closely related species (or individuals within a species), you’re probably interested in comparing DNA. If you want to find homologous sequences from distantly related species, you’re probably interested in comparing proteins (since many synonymous DNA triplets code for the same amino acid, DNA tends to evolve faster than proteins, making it harder to compare across distantly related life forms).\n",

The features used to determine the best match are described in the __`Query Cover`__ column (how much of the query is covered by the database match), and the __`Per. Ident`__ (percent indentity) column (how similar are the query and match sequences). `Query Cover` and `Per. Ident` are used to calculate the __`E Value`__, which is the likelihood that the query and match look similar by chance (in other words, the probability that they are not homologous). An E-value cutoff of 10e-5 is often used to determine whether genes are homologous or not, but to know for sure a scientist has to do lots of additional, careful study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first hit has 100% “Query cover” and 100% “Ident”, meaning it’s identical to the sequence we submitted. According to the E-value, the probability that these two sequences match perfectly by chance is 1-76 (that is pretty unlikely). In other words, our query is a perfect match to the “class IV POU domain” protein in the earthworm (*Lumbricus terrestris*). We’ve identified the mystery gene!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this best hit, we can look at other similar genes from other organisms. The next best hit comes from *Helobdella robusta*. Do you know what kind of organism that is? If not, try searching the name in Google. Does it make sense that our gene from *Lumbricus* is very similar to a gene from *Helobdella*? Check out some of the other species on the list. If you don’t recognize the name, search for it online. These are homologous genes from all sorts of different animals.\n",
